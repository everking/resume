Welcome to my website, which I'm using to review,
enhance and showcase my front-end skills.

However, as you can see in my [resume](/resume), I definitely 
do a lot more than front-end develpment.

I started my career writing firmware code using assembler language 
that was literally burned into the chip to deploy to handheld computer.

Since then, I'd bee working on databases, desktop applications, 
systems management coding, and all aspects of web development.

Essentially, I do what needs to be done. 

I go where I'm needed.

It doesn't mean that I don't care where I go or what I do.

It's just that, I seem to have this knack on making un-intesting 
things interesting, through curiousity and creativity. 

For example, we wanted to send customized Christmas cards 
to family and friends. I wrote code in VB for Applications to 
tell CorelDraw to export images with their names.

In Chevron, when I'm on a "graveyard" shift, I could have just 
done my usual checklist, monitoring servers, doing walkthroughs,
etc. Instead, during quiet times and there are a lot of those, 
I wrote code creating flash (flex) based dashboard shown on TVs.

Basically. I love coding.

I love technology.

I'm creative and persistent enough that I'm able to find ways 
to do it in a lot of very different ways.

By the way, I pride myself as an artist (graphics designer) 
as well, so, I try to sprinkle that wheneveer there's an 
opportunity to do so. This website is an excellent example.

Thank you for taking the time to read this blog post.

Cheers!
