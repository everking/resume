I wrote code in VB for Applications to \\ntell CorelDraw to export images with their names.\\n\\nIn Chevron, when I\'m on a \\"graveyard\\" shift, I could have just \\ndone my usual checklist, monitoring servers, doing walkthroughs,\\netc. Instead, during quiet times and there are a lot of those, \\nI wrote code creating flash (flex) based dashboard shown on TVs.\\n\\nBasically. I love coding.\\n\\nI love technology. \\n\\nOthers have painting, reading or sports to do at their liesure time. \\nI have technology.\\n\\nI\'m creative and persistent enough that I\'m able to find ways \\nto do it in a lot of very different ways.\\n\\nBy the way, I pride myself as an artist\\nas well, so, I try to sprinkle that wheneveer there\'s an \\nopportunity to do so. This website is an excellent example.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this blog post.\\n\\nCheers!"}]}')}}]);
